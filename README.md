Welcome to our Titanic Data Analytics project!

In this project, I will be working with the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers who were aboard the Titanic when it sank in 1912. The dataset includes information such as passenger demographics, ticket class, fare paid, cabin information, and whether or not the passenger survived.

My goals for this project is to explore the data and identify patterns or trends that may be related to passenger survival. I will be utilizing various analytical techniques such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, univariate analysis and bivariate analysis to build predictive models.

Through this analysis, I hope to gain insights into what factors contributed to passenger survival and make predictions about the survival rate of other passengers in the dataset. My findings may have implications for improving safety measures on future cruises.
